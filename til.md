Wrote a blog and a script to Organize Desktop and group similar files in a Directory
##### ``` echo '\n#### ' `date` ``` appends UNIX commands  `date` to string in shell  

How to check if a string endswith any of the elements from a list in python?
     
  > such list of string  must be `tuple`  for that purpose

```python

>>> photos_extension = ("jpg", "JPEG", "jpeg","png","HEIC","svg","JPG")
>>> file_name = "picofNepal.jpg"
>>> file_name.endswith(photos_extension)
True

```
