- Wrote a blog and a script to Organize Desktop and group similar files in a Directory
- ``` echo '\n#### ' `date` ``` appends UNIX commands  `date` to string in shell  
- How to check if a string ends with any of the elements
        *   such list of string  must be `tuple`  for that purpose

 ```python

>>> photos_extension = ("jpg", "JPEG", "jpeg","png","HEIC","svg","JPG")
>>> file_name = "picofNepal.jpg"
>>> file_name.endswith(photos_extension)
True
```
